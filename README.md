# **Zygr – TypeScript Native Compiler**  

## **Overview**  

**Zygr** is a compiler that translates TypeScript directly into native machine code, eliminating the need for JavaScript or a runtime environment. Instead of transpiling to JavaScript and running in an engine, **Zygr** produces standalone executables that run natively on the CPU.  

### **Key Goals:**  

- **Native Execution** – Run TypeScript as a compiled, standalone binary.  
- **No JavaScript Runtime** – Completely bypass JavaScript and its ecosystem.  
- **High Performance** – Optimize TypeScript execution with a modern compilation pipeline.
