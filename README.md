# tsc-native

## Overview

This project is a basic compiler that takes TypeScript code as input and compiles it directly to native machine code. Instead of transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript, this compiler generates machine code that can be executed directly by the CPU. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient way to run TypeScript code without relying on a JavaScript runtime.
